# AI-audio-translation-solution-for-visually-impaired-individuals-who-speak-Ewe
In many parts of the world, navigating public spaces remains a significant challenge for visually impaired individuals. The ability to accurately interpret and respond to spoken directions supports their independence and safety. This challenge aims to develop language models capable of recognising basic directional words in Ewe, a language spoken in parts of West Africa.
The solutions will be used in a navigation voice assistant for visually impaired individuals who speak Ew√®. By focusing on this specific use case, the challenge underscores the potential of AI for social good, particularly in underrepresented African languages.
